# Registering an S3 Bucket
If you have access to an S3 bucket, you can register it as a Tapis system to allow
Tapis to manage files and folders on the bucket.

```python

s3_system = {
  "id":"<userid>.<bucket_name>",
  "description":"My Bucket",
  "host":"<url_to_bucket>",
  "systemType":"S3",
  "defaultAuthnMethod":"ACCESS_KEY",
  "effectiveUserId":"${owner}",
  "bucketName":"<bucket_name>",
  "rootDir":"/",
  "canExec": False
}
```

Replace the following in the above:
* `<userid>-<bucket_name>` - A unique id for this system. As indicated, we recommend using
a combination of your username and the bucket name.
* `<url_to_bucket>` - The root URL to the bucket in AWS (e.g., "https://tapis-sample-test-<userid>.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/")
* `<bucket_name>` - The name of the actual bucket (e.g., "tapis-test-bucket")
